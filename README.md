# iOS WeatherApp with SwiftUI


## Overview

`iOS WeatherApp` is similarly designed from the `Apple Weather App` and uses [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and built with SwiftUI. Features this app include: get current weather & details, get hourly forecast weather and get daily forecast. But details are not exactly the same due to limited free plan from Openweathermap API.
